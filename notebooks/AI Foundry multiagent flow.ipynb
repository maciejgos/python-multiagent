When sunlight passes through the Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with air molecules and small particles. Sunlight, or white light, is composed of different colors, each with varying wavelengths. Blue light has a shorter wavelength compared to other colors like red or yellow.\n",
      "\n",
      "As sunlight encounters the atmosphere, the shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) are scattered in all directions by the gases and particles. However, our eyes are more sensitive to blue light than to violet light, and some of the violet light is absorbed by the ozone layer, which means we perceive the sky as blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the sun is lower in the sky, such as during sunrise or sunset, the light has to pass through a greater thickness of the atmosphere. This increased distance scatters the shorter wavelengths more and allows the longer wavelengths (reds and oranges) to dominate, resulting in the beautiful colors we see at those times.\n"

      "3. **Unique Skills**: The skills present in the candidate dataset seem to be diverse but lack a direct match with the requirements set forth in the job description. This suggests a potential gap in candidate qualifications.\n",
