When sunlight passes through the Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with air molecules and small particles. Sunlight, or white light, is composed of different colors, each with varying wavelengths. Blue light has a shorter wavelength compared to other colors like red or yellow.\n",
      "\n",
      "As sunlight encounters the atmosphere, the shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) are scattered in all directions by the gases and particles. However, our eyes are more sensitive to blue light than to violet light, and some of the violet light is absorbed by the ozone layer, which means we perceive the sky as blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the sun is lower in the sky, such as during sunrise or sunset, the light has to pass through a greater thickness of the atmosphere. This increased distance scatters the shorter wavelengths more and allows the longer wavelengths (reds and oranges) to dominate, resulting in the beautiful colors we see at those times.\n"

      "1. I will print out the unique skills listed by candidates to verify whether any of the required skills from the job description are present.\n",

      "Since the dataset may not contain candidates suitable for the Operations Engineer - Support Line 2 position based on the specific requirements shared, it may be necessary to seek candidates with more relevant experience or explore additional datasets.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Candidate Data**: Upon examining the uploaded dataset, it appears that none of the candidates strictly meet these specific criteria, particularly in the key areas like Azure experience and proficiency with CI/CD tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Unique Skills**: The skills present in the candidate dataset seem to be diverse but lack a direct match with the requirements set forth in the job description. This suggests a potential gap in candidate qualifications.\n",

      "### Next Steps:\n",
      "- **Review Other Candidate Sources**: If there are additional candidates or datasets available, we could expand the search for suitable applicants.\n",

      "1. **Job Role**: Operations Engineer - Support Line 2 at ITMAGINATION.\n",
      "2. **Key Requirements**:\n",
      "   - Minimum 5 years in DevOps or SRE.\n",
      "   - 2 years working with Azure and knowledge of various Azure services.\n",
      "   - Proficiency in CI/CD tools and incident/change/problem management awareness.\n",

      "3. **Candidate Data Analysis**:\n",
      "   - After reviewing the uploaded candidate data, it was found that there were no candidates that strictly matched the job's requirements.\n",
